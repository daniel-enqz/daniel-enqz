# Arrays and Strings

### The magic of pointers in an Array
In the next example, if we move each pinter (2) one index in each iteration, the cost of the inner operation will be always constant O(1), meaning that as there's only one iteration happening. We always end up having a time complexity of O(n).


```python
function fn(arr):
    left = 0
    right = arr.length - 1

    while left < right:
        Do some logic here depending on the problem
        Do some more logic here to decide on one of the following:
            1. left++
            2. right--
            3. Both left++ and right--
```
