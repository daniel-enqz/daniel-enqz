# Essentials

## [Arrays](https://github.com/daniel-enqz/daniel-enqz/tree/main/PROGRAMMING_COURSE💙/🐬DATA_STRUCTURES/TREES)
  - Definition: Ordered collections of objects
  - Common Operations: adding elements, accessing elements, deleting elements, finding the size of an array
  - Example Code: 
  ```ruby
  # Creating an array
  array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

  # Adding an element to the end of the array
  array << 6

  # Accessing an element by index
  array[2] # => 3

  # Deleting an element by index
  array.delete_at(3)

  # Finding the size of an array
  array.size # => 5
